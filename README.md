You also need expo go installed on your phone to run the app.

## Useful documentation

__React Native__ is a framework for building native apps using React.  
It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.  
Below all the documentation that we used to build this app.  

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started)
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/quick-start)
- [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) &rarr; very useful for the Camera, FileSystem, MailCompsoer, etc.
